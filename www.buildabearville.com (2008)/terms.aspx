                <p>When you enter the Website, you will be asked to register by creating a username which will also serve as the name for the graphical representation of a character in the virtual world (such representation, an "<u>Avatar</u>").   Do not use personal information that can identify who you are when choosing your username.   At the time your account is opened, you must also select a password.  After providing your username and password, we will also collect answers about you that will help us identify you in case you forget your password in the future.  Additionally, we collect your birth month and year, email address, parent’s email address, and gender (collectively the “Registration Data”).  You agree that all of the Registration Data that you will provide to Build-A-Bear Workshop is accurate, truthful, and current.  You agree that you will not:  (i) select a username that, to your knowledge, is already used by another person; (ii) use a username in which another person has rights without such person’s authorization; or (iii) use a username or password that Build-A-Bear Workshop, in its sole discretion, deems offensive or inappropriate.  Build-A-Bear Workshop has no obligation to verify the authenticity of any Registration Data, but you authorize Build-A-Bear Workshop, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your Registration Data.  We reserve the right to terminate any username for any reason.  Build-A-Bear Workshop reserves all rights to vigorously pursue legal action against all persons who misrepresent personal information or are otherwise untruthful about their identity, and to suspend or cancel accounts registered with inaccurate or incomplete information. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Registration Data and password and are responsible for any harm resulting from your disclosure, or authorizing the disclosure of, your password or from use by any person of your password to gain access to your account or username.</p>
                <p>If you violate these terms and conditions, Build-A-Bear Workshop reserves the right to suspend or delete any or all of your accounts, block your access to this Website, and/or take further legal action as described more fully below.  Build-A-Bear Workshop reserves the right to suspend any account that has been inactive for six (6) months or more. If your account has been suspended for inactivity, you may reactivate it.  Reactivation may take several minutes.</p>

                <p>(vi)     a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed); and,</p>
                <p>(vii)     your electronic or physical signature.</p>

                <p>Build-A-Bear Workshop may elect to not respond to DMCA notices that do not comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and Build-A-Bear Workshop may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not comply with the DMCA.

                <h3>15.     Contests</h3>
                <p>We may offer contests for which we may collect non-personal information (such as first name, age, city and state).  If you participate in the contest or send us a question we may also ask for an email address.  If we know a visitor is under the age of thirteen, we will require the child give us a parent or guardian email address, so that we can tell the parent or guardian that the child is registered in a contest.  If we need more than an email address and first name for the child to participate in the contest, we will notify the parent or guardian, explain what information we need and why we need it, and generally ask that the parent or guardian (not child) provide it.  Any information the parent or guardian (or child) gives us in the above special circumstances will be deleted from our database once the contest or program is complete, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete. No one will be excluded from this Website for not giving us this information.</p>
