				<div id="test1-header" class="accordion_headings header_highlight2" >Help Your Kids Play Safe Online</div>
				<div id="test1-content">
					<div class="accordion_child">
						There is no substitute for watching what sites your child is visiting and who your child is interacting with online, but these tips can help you talk to your children about playing safe online. 
					</div>
				</div>

				<div id="test2-header" class="accordion_headings" >What are cyberbullies?</div>
				<div id="test2-content">
					<div class="accordion_child">
						Cyberbullies are just like bullies at school, but since they do their bullying online, they can sometimes be more dangerous. Cyberbullies can hide their identity and usually there is no one around to see the harm that they are causing. It's hard for teachers to get involved because this type of bullying usually takes place outside of school.

						Cyberbullying can affect children as young as 7 through their high school years. For younger children especially, cyberbullying is often password theft. In Build-A-Bearville&trade; your child works hard to win prizes and earn Bear Bills&reg; and it can be heartbreaking to lose everything to a cyberbully who knows their password.
						<br /><br />As a parent, it is important for you to know who your child is interacting with online and make sure they are not giving out information they should not. 
						<br /><br />We at Build-A-Bearville are always working to make the Internet a safer place for children. Through our safe chat system, kids can chat safely with others by choosing from pre-approved phrases, preventing them from sharing personal information with strangers. 
					</div>
				</div>

				<div id="test3-header" class="accordion_headings" >Chat in Build-A-Bearville</div> 
				<div id="test3-content">
					<div class="accordion_child">
						<p> 
							An important part of the buildabearville.com&reg; experience is chat. We have partnered with parents, teachers, children and industry experts to develop a simple to use, filtered and fun Chat system:<br /><br /> 
						</p> 
						<ul id="chatUL"> 
							<li>Safe Open Chat: Children using Safe Open Chat can type their own phrases, provided they are included in an approved dictionary of words and phrases. This system uses the approved dictionary combined with filters that prevent the use of numbers, symbols and inappropriate communications.</li> 
							<li>Instant Chat: Instant Chat allows users to choose what they want to say from a list of prewritten approved phrases. This is our default chat type and will be automatically on your child's account.</li> 
							<li>Silent Chat: Silent chat is also available if you do not wish to use or see chat in Build-A-Bearville.</li> 
						</ul> 
						<p> 
							We believe all options are safe and fun, but to use Safe Open Chat parental permission is required.
							If you would prefer that your child not chat or view others chatting in the world, you can set their chat type to Silent by selecting the &quot;Change Chat&quot; option in the PDA.
						</p>

				<div id="test4-header" class="accordion_headings" >Passwords</div>
				<div id="test4-content">
					<div class="accordion_child">
						<b>-</b> Passwords should be easy to remember, hard to guess. If your kids have to write it down, it's too hard to remember. If it's a pet's name, their middle name, their favorite sports team, etc., it's too easy to guess. Sit down with your kids and talk about ideas for a password, and remember a combination of numbers and letters is always best.<br />
						<b>-</b> Don't allow your kids to give out their password to others. 85% of elementary school students and 70% of teens we polled said they shared their password with at least one friend. That's one friend too many!<br />
						<b>-</b> Friends can be cyberbullies too, signing onto your child's account, impersonating them and possibly embarrassing them. They can also change your child's password, locking them out of their account.

						Talk through these rules with your child before they play online.<br />
						<ul class="listtab">
							<li><b>- The Build-A-Bearville Golden Rule:</b> Don't do anything online that you wouldn't do in real life.</li>
							<li><b>-</b> Don't do anything <b>parents, principals, predators</b> or the <b>police</b> shouldn't see. As they get older, add a <b>5th P</b> &ndash; prospective employers or college recruiters! Remember that anyone you meet online that you don't know in real life is not a "friend" it's just someone you know online. </li>
							<li><b>-</b> Never meet in person with anyone you only know from the Internet. You never know who they really are! </li>
							<li><b>-</b> What you post online stays online &ndash; forever! Remember that and <b>thinkb4uClick!</b> </li>
							<li><b>-</b> You are what you post &ndash; you can be the most incredible person in real life, but no one knows that if you aren't incredible online too. </li>
							<li><b>-</b> If you get a mean message or see something posted about you online &ndash; <b>Stop, Block and Tell!</b> Stop, don't answer back, block the person or message and tell a trusted adult!  </li>
							<li><b>-</b> Make sure you have <b>protective security software</b> downloaded to avoid viruses that kids may click on by accident.</li>
