Build-A-Bear Workshop has no obligation to verify the authenticity of any Registration Data, but you authorize Build-A-Bear Workshop, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your Registration Data. We reserve the right to terminate any username for any reason. Build-A-Bear Workshop reserves all rights to vigorously pursue legal action against all persons who misrepresent personal information or are otherwise untruthful about their identity, and to suspend or cancel accounts registered with inaccurate or incomplete information. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Registration Data and password and are responsible for any harm resulting from your disclosure, or authorizing the disclosure of, your password or from use by any person of your password to gain access to your account or username.

						<p>
							Build-A-Bear Workshop will respond appropriately to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), as set forth below. If you own copyrights in a work and believe that your intellectual property rights in that work have been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via this Website, then send us a written notice that includes all of the following: </p>
								
					  <ul>
							<li> (i) a legend or subject line that says: "DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice"; </li>
							<li> (ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; </li>
							<li> (iii) the URL of the site and a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on that site;</li>

							<li> (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the alleged infringing material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; </li>
							<li> (vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed); and, </li>
							<li> (vii) your electronic or physical signature. </li>
					  </ul>
					  
							<p> Build-A-Bear Workshop will only receive DMCA notices by mail, e-mail, or facsimile at the addresses below: </p>

					<h4>15. Contests</h4>
					<p>
						We may offer contests for which we may collect non-personal information (such as first name, age, city and state). If you participate in the contest or send us a question we may also ask for an email address. If we know a visitor is under the age of thirteen, we will require the child give us a parent or guardian email address, so that we can tell the parent or guardian that the child is registered in a contest. If we need more than an email address and first name for the child to participate in the contest, we will notify the parent or guardian, explain what information we need and why we need it, and generally ask that the parent or guardian (not child) provide it. Any information the parent or guardian (or child) gives us in the above special circumstances will be deleted from our database once the contest or program is complete, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete. No one will be excluded from this Website for not giving us this information.
					</p>
