			<h5>How to create a Bearrific™ password!</h5>
						<h3>How do I choose my password?</h3>
					  <p>Be creative – your password should be easy for you to remember but hard for other people to guess.  Pet’s names,  family members’ names, birthdays or even your favorite 										activity might be too easy for others to guess. Using both letters and numbers is a great way to make your password super safe.
					  <h3>How do I keep my password safe? </h3>
						<ul>
										<li><b>1.</b> Don’t share your password with anyone except your parents, not even your beary best friend!</li>
										<li><b>2.</b> If someone finds your password, change it right away!</li>
										<li><b>3.</b> On public computers, like those you use at school or the library, <b>always</b> unclick the “remember me” button so that strangers can’t login to your account after you leave.</li></ul>
						<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
						<p>If a cyberbully knows your password, they can lock you out of your account, change your character, spend your Bear Bills<sup>®</sup> and pretend they’re you when they talk to other characters online.  <br />

		<h5>Stop Cyberbullies!</h5>
						<p>A cyberbully is anyone who uses the Internet, phone or other device to send or post hurtful messages or images to others. It also includes anyone who might log onto your account without your permission. If you feel hurt by someone who has done something like this to you, always tell a trusted adult.
						</p>
							<h3>STOP, BLOCK and TELL</h3>
					  <p>We have worked beary hard to make sure that Build-A-Bearville™ is a safe place for you and your furry friends to play, but sometimes it can still be misused.

If another player is bullying you, just double click on their character and click on “report player”. We take all reports beary seriously and will investigate them right away.
					  </p>
					  	<h3>Keep your personal information is PERSONAL</h3>
					  <p>Never share your real name, address, phone number, age, name of your school or any other personal information with anyone online.

			 Cyberbullies are just like bullies at school, but since they do their bullying online, they can sometimes be more dangerous. Cyberbullies can hide their identity and usually there is no one around to see the harm that they are causing. It’s hard for teachers to get involved because this type of bullying usually takes place outside of school.

Cyberbullying can affect children as young as 7 through their high school years. For younger children especially, cyberbullying is often password theft. In Build-A-Bearville™ your child works hard to win prizes and earn Bear Bills<sup>®</sup> and it can be heartbreaking to lose everything to a cyberbully who knows their password.
<br /><br />As a parent, it is important for you to know who your child is interacting with online and make sure they are not giving out information they should not. 
<br /><br />We at Build-A-Bearville are always working to make the Internet a safer place for children. Through our safe chat system, kids can chat safely with others by choosing from pre-approved phrases, preventing them from sharing personal information with strangers.

	<b>-</b> Passwords should be easy to remember, hard to guess. If your kids have to write it down, it’s too hard to remember. If it’s a pet’s name, their middle name, their favorite sports team, etc., it’s too easy to guess. Sit down with your kids and talk about ideas for a password, and remember a combination of numbers and letters is always best.<br />
	<b>-</b> Don’t allow your kids to give out their password to others. 85% of elementary school students and 70% of teens we polled said they shared their password with at least one friend. That’s one friend too many!<br />
	<b>-</b> Friends can be cyberbullies too, signing onto your child’s account, impersonating them and possibly embarrassing them. They can also change your child’s password, locking them out of their account.

Talk through these rules with your child before they play online.<br />

						<ul>
										<li><b>- The Build-A-Bearville Golden Rule:</b> Don’t do anything online that you wouldn’t do in real life.</li>
										<li><b>-</b> Don’t do anything <b>parents, principals, predators</b> or the <b>police</b> shouldn’t see. As they get older, add a <b>5th P</b>  – prospective employers or college recruiters! Remember that anyone you meet online that you don’t know in real life is not a “friend” it’s just someone you know online. </li>
										<li><b>-</b> Never meet in person with anyone you only know from the Internet. You never know who they really are! </li>
										<li><b>-</b> What you post online stays online – forever! Remember that and <b>thinkb4uClick!</b> </li>
										<li><b>-</b> You are what you post – you can be the most incredible person in real life, but no one knows that if you aren’t incredible online too. </li>
										<li><b>-</b> If you get a mean message or see something posted about you online – <b>Stop, Block and Tell!</b> Stop, don’t answer back, block the person or message and tell a trusted adult!  </li>
										<li><b>-</b> Make sure you have <b>protective security software</b> downloaded to avoid viruses that kids may click on by accident.</li>
