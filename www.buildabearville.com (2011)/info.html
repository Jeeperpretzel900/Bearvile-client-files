						<h3>A note fur parents</h3>
						<p>Dear Guest,<br /><br />
						My name is Dave Finnegan and I am Chief Information Bear at Build-A-Bear Workshop®.
						My responsibilities include the development and oversight of buildabearville.com™, our virtual world.
						We were founded in 1997 as a company for children and about children. We have created a safe place
						in your local mall where your children can play, express their creativity and use their imagination.
						When we created buildabearville.com we brought those same qualities that you have valued and trusted
						in us as a parent for the last 10 years, into the virtual world space. Your family’s safety continues
						to be our top priority. As the father of three children, I understand and support the importance our
						company places on being a leader in safety in this relatively new space of virtual worlds.<br /><br />
						It takes all of us working together – a company who cares, parents who are engaged and aware of their
						children’s online activities, and children who are educated and aware.<br /><br />
						Our site was created with many features to help ensure a safe experience for your child and has
						been monitored for safe play since day one. We are partnering with organizations that support child safety,
						such as INOBTR.org, an organization dedicated to finding tools and providing education to keep kids safe
						online. I encourage you to be involved and be educated, along with your children.<br /><br />
						During the development of the virtual world, and always, we listen to feedback from Guests –
						both parents and children alike. I hope you find the information in this Internet Safety section of our
						website helpful. If you have further questions or want to provide me with feedback or ideas that
						you have about buildabearville.com, please email me at virtualdave@buildabear.com.<br /><br />
						Also, if you would like more information on Internet safety, please visit
						<a href="javascript:ChangePage('inobtr')" title="inobtr.org">inobtr.org</a><br /><br />
						Beary truly yours,<br /><br />
						Dave Finnegan<br />
						Chief Information Bear</p>

						<h3>Instant Chat</h3>
						<p>We have taken several important steps for safe online chat in buildabearville.com.  We use a safe menu chat system,
						called Instant Chat (IC), where Guests can type in their chat bar and see a list of phrases to choose. We are continuously
						developing ways to enhance IC and to make it easier and more intuitive for the user which we think will help our Guests
						communicate with even more expression!<br /><br />
						If you would prefer that your child not chat or view others chatting in the world, you can set their chat
						type to Silent by selecting the "Change Chat" option in the PDA.</p><br /><br />

						<h3>Parent Advisory Panel</h3>
						<p>Build-A-Bear Workshop was founded in St. Louis in 1997 and grew as a business based on integrity, value,
						fun, and giving back to our community. We have been successful because we have listened to our Guests --
						children and parents, every step of the way.<br /><br />
						We believe that parents play a significant role in helping to ensure the online safety of their children. 
						We have always had a Parent Advisory Panel.  The Panel – a parent group that from time to time is asked to
						review and give input on products, services and online features – has been a source of important input since
						we launched our online community.<br /><br />
						If you would like to join our Parent’s Advisory Panel, please send an email to parentadvisors@buildabear.com.<br /><br />
						It is interested and engaged Guests, like our Parent Advisory Panel, who help us do a better job!</p><br /><br />

						<h3>Jr. CyBearGuide™ Program</h3>
						<p>We launched an online Jr. CyBearGuide™ program in buildabearville.com in August 2008. The program allows
						qualified members of the online community to act as guides by answering questions, providing information and
						even giving tours.  Each Jr. CyBearGuide™ member’s online character receives a unique Jr. CyBearGuide™ Cap – a
						blue hat with a star – to help distinguish them within the online community and let others know that they are
						there to help and answer questions.  In addition to providing assistance and answering questions for
						buildabearville.com visitors, the Jr. CyBearGuide™ members will also be asked from time to time to lend their
						opinions and suggestions on improvements that can be made in the world.<br /><br />
						If you or your child is interested in becoming a Jr. CyBearGuide™ member visit the Bear University in
						Build-A-Bearville™. Click the paw under the big Jr. CyBearGuide™ blue star to learn all about the program.
						If you meet the qualifications, visit the Classroom to take your test to get started.<br /><br />
						If you do not have an account at buildabearville.com yet, email vwhelp@buildabear.com
						and ask about how to create an account and become a Jr. CyBearGuide™ member!</p>
